# winchange - watch changes in terminal dimensions
#
# DESCRIPTION
# ========
# winchange lets you observe a terminal's dimensions while changing the size of
# a terminal. It is especially useful when a terminal emulator won't tell you
# the dimensions of a terminal while you're resizing it, or if you're using
# a terminal multiplexer with split panes like tmux.
#
# Usage:
#
#     winchange
#
# Leave winchange running until you've resized the terminal to the desired size
# and then Ctrl-C to kill it.
