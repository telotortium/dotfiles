# dotfiles

Contains my dotfiles

## Setup

I'm currently placing my working tree in my home directory while locating the
Git directory elsewhere, as inspired by [this Hacker News post][1]. To set this
up upon the initial clone, run the script
[`.dotfiles-setup.bash`](.dotfiles-setup.bash) from the root of this
repository.
